## Course Material Distribution
 
Here are some logistics about the online course.

This is an experiment, so please be patient with me and with yourself. I know that a lot of you really want to learn R, but please know that I am only one person. But I want to help you learn.

This course is based on a course I am giving at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). That course is only open to OHSU students. I will be trying to share as much of the course materials as I can.

1. **Code of Conduct**. This class is governed by the BioData Club Code of Conduct: https://biodata-club.github.io/code_of_conduct/  This class is meant to be a psychologically safe space where itâ€™s ok to ask questions. I want to normalize your own curiosity and fuel your desire to learn more. If you are disruptive to class learning or disparaging to other students, I may mute you from the Slack for the day. I am very serious about this.

2. **Website**. Most of you have found the website. If not, it is here: https://ready4r.netlify.com. I will be posting readings and responses to questions there. It's not quite completely ready yet, be patient.

You can read about the course learning objectives here: https://ready4r.netlify.com/syllabus/

3. **RStudio Cloud**. The course will be deployed via RStudio.Cloud. RStudio Cloud is a web-based instance of R/RStudio that you can use for free and that I use for teaching. You can sign up here: https://rstudio.cloud. Later this week I will send an invite to the mailing list to join the Ready for R RStudio Cloud workspace.

4. **Video Releases**. I will be trying to release videos of each class the weekend after the OHSU class (the first class is April 9). Please be aware that I am just one person and that I will try to get these out as fast as I can.

5. **Slack Workspace**. I will be sending invites later this week to a slack workspace. I will do my best to field questions and answers there. However, please be aware that I am only one person. The R for Data Science community is a great place to ask questions: https://www.rfordatasci.com/ 

6. **Alternatives**. This is not the only intro to R course out there. There is another course that I suggest: David Keyes' R for the Rest of Us course: https://rfortherestofus.com/ 

David is a great instructor, and his course is free and excellent. In fact, I suggest that you take a look at his material if you need another reference or things are confusing. 

Jessica Minnier and I have also co-authored the R-Bootcamp, which this material is based on. We'll be covering very similar bases, but this is a self-paced option for those who want it. I do recommend at least sitting in on the first session of Ready for R before starting it: https://r-bootcamp.netlify.app/

Thanks again for your interest and I'll do my best to help you in your journey to learning R.
