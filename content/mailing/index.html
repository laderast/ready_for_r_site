<p>If you’re external to OHSU, but you want access to the Ready for R course materials, please join our mailing list. We will update you when material and videos become available.</p>

<h2>Course Material Distribution</h2>
<p>Here are some logistics about the online course for external folks.</p>
<p>This is an experiment, so please be patient with me and with yourself. I know that a lot of you really want to learn R, but please know that I am only one person. But I want to help you learn.</p>
<p>This course is based on a course I am giving at Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU). That course is only open to OHSU students. I will be trying to share as much of the course materials as I can.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Code of Conduct</strong>. This class is governed by the BioData Club Code of Conduct: <a href="https://biodata-club.github.io/code_of_conduct/" class="uri">https://biodata-club.github.io/code_of_conduct/</a> This class is meant to be a psychologically safe space where it’s ok to ask questions. I want to normalize your own curiosity and fuel your desire to learn more. If you are disruptive to class learning or disparaging to other students, I may mute you from the Slack for the day. I am very serious about this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Website</strong>. Most of you have found the website. If not, it is here: <a href="https://ready4r.netlify.com" class="uri">https://ready4r.netlify.com</a>. I will be posting readings and responses to questions there. It’s not quite completely ready yet, be patient.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You can read about the course learning objectives here: <a href="https://ready4r.netlify.com/syllabus/" class="uri">https://ready4r.netlify.com/syllabus/</a></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>RStudio Cloud</strong>. The course will be deployed via RStudio.Cloud. RStudio Cloud is a web-based instance of R/RStudio that you can use for free and that I use for teaching. You can sign up here: <a href="https://rstudio.cloud" class="uri">https://rstudio.cloud</a>. Later this week I will send an invite to the mailing list to join the Ready for R RStudio Cloud workspace.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Video Releases</strong>. I will be trying to release videos of each class the weekend after the OHSU class (the first class is April 9). Please be aware that I am just one person and that I will try to get these out as fast as I can.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Slack Workspace</strong>. I have retired the Slack workspace. The R for Data Science community is a great place to ask questions: <a href="https://www.rfordatasci.com/" class="uri">https://www.rfordatasci.com/</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Course is not Graded</strong>. There is no credit provided for this course. It is purely for your learning benefit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Alternatives</strong>. This is not the only intro to R course out there. There is another course that I suggest: David Keyes’ R for the Rest of Us course: <a href="https://rfortherestofus.com/" class="uri">https://rfortherestofus.com/</a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>David is a great instructor, and his course is free and excellent. In fact, I suggest that you take a look at his material if you need another reference or things are confusing.</p>
<p>Jessica Minnier and I have also co-authored the R-Bootcamp, which this material is based on. We’ll be covering very similar bases, but this is a self-paced option for those who want it. I do recommend at least sitting in on the first session of Ready for R before starting it: <a href="https://r-bootcamp.netlify.app/" class="uri">https://r-bootcamp.netlify.app/</a></p>
<p>Thanks again for your interest and I’ll do my best to help you in your journey to learning R.</p>
