# Learning Objectives

By the end of this course you will be able to:

1. **Understand** and **utilize** **R/RStudio**.
2. **Understand** basic data types and data structures in R.
3. **Familiarize** and **load** data files (Excel, Comma Separated Value files) into R/Rstudio, with tips on formatting.
4. **Visualize** datasets using **ggplot2** and understand how to build basic plots using **ggplot2** syntax.
5. **Filter** and **format** data in R for use with various routines.
6. **Execute** and **Interpret** some basic statistics in R.

# My Approach to Teaching

I think students learn the best when they're actually looking and thinking about data.

This means we will be looking at lots of data.

I also think that we learn best when we are discussing data together.

# This is a Safe Space to Ask Questions

---
# Code of Conduct

This class is governed by the [BioData Club Code of Conduct](https://biodata-club.github.io/code_of_conduct/).

This class is meant to be a psychologically safe space where it's ok to ask questions.

I want to normalize your own curiosity and fuel your desire to learn more.

If you are disruptive to class learning or disparaging to other students, I may mute you for the day.

---
# Class Slack

I have created a class Slack here: http://ready4r.slack.com - the invite link will be sent out.

I will try to answer questions there when I can. We'll take a tour of class next week.

I am inviting external people who are intereseted in learning R as well, but you will have your own private channel and get priority.

If you have a question, please ask it in a public channel, rather than a private message, so it can benefit everyone.

# One Note about Scheduling

I only work 4 days a week. I'm not available on Wednesdays.

---
# Class Assignments

Class Assignments will be done in RStudio Notebooks (more during lab)

Assignments will be submitted through Sakai. 

We will do our best to return it to you 1 week after due date

---
# Why R?

R is an extremely powerful language for **statistical modeling**, machine learning, data manipulation, and visualization.

It's a *hub* language in that you can access many different kinds of systems (TensorFlow, Databases, Apache Spark) without needing to know other languages.

---
# R is Not Easy

- Learning R can be a difficult, but rewarding process
- Be patient with yourself, don't beat yourself up
- We'll try to make it a fun process for you
