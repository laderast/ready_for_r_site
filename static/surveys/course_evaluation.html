I feel like I'm going to be able to search and figure out much of what I want to accomplish now.  \n\nAs a side note, I really appreciate your transparency about your mental health struggles - particularly in the current climate.  It felt like it gave me permission to not always be perfectly attentive and that it would be okay if I felt like I was picking things up too slowly as long as I kept trying.  \n\nYou're a good teacher, thank for all your hard work and time. \n\nCheers, \nElaine\n\np.s. i really do want to hear the squirrel and chipmunk story sometime.","Dear Ted.\n\nThank you!

I was able to understand the fundamentals and, also, it gave me confidence to continue learning.\n\nThanks a lot!","Dear Ted, \n\nHow do you improve your skills in R?","Excellent instructing! Thanks.","Dear Ted\n\nThanks sooo much for putting your class online. I checked other online classes and none of them were as organized as your class. I hope you keep this site up forever! I recommended it for everyone in my program (Applied Linguistics at NAU) and to all my R Ladies friends. I had taken a class on multivariate stats using R and I don't know how we did not lean about the tidyverse! This was really awesome.","Dear Ted, \n\nYour courage in opening your course to the broader #rstats community should be applauded (loudly). While the world around me spiraled out of control, the lessons you spent some much time creating brought me intense joy. Your course gave me a great example of how I would like to engage with my future students. You are an amazing educator, and the statistics education community is lucky to have you.","Dear Ted, \n\nThank you for dedicating your time to make R accesible to all, \nthe coure was amazing!","Dear Ted, \nI am an external attendee of your course. I am truly impressed by how you masterly managed the course (resources, slack channel, clarity of contents, availability of codes, etc). Thank you for this learning opportunity! Best, Giulia Solinas","Dear Ted,\nThanks so much for this. It's been great.","Dear Ted, \nI have used other standard softwares for my stats during my doctoral program and was always intimidated by R. I am so glad I found this course, after going through numerous online videos &amp; courses. It is taking me time to learn through your course, but I am confident that this time I will get through it. Your teaching style is wonderful and you are very encouraging to the students. I certainly will go through your videos over and over again to get me through. This has given me the confidence to start a new analysis with a large dataset. \nThank you \nKulbir Kaur","Dear Ted, you have done it great!","Dear Ted,\nThank you!","The course was very interactive, especially where the tutor openly shows where he got some of the resources (ie. website). This is an eye opener for many of us. Am fortunate to be part of this rich experience.","Dear Ted, I've taken many intro to R courses, this is definitely one of the best.","Dear Ted,\n\nThank you so much for this course. The pace was just right for this R novice, who has come out of this experience determined to learn more. l am also enjoying  the weekly newsletters.","Dear Ted, I would just like to thank you for making this course available. I was new to R and had been going through numerous resources to self teach. Your course helped me gain confidence with R and my script writring as although I had learned some of the content before I was unsure if some of my methods were best practice etc. Having yourself talk over the content providing examples and also answering student related questions was really helpful to see how some queries I had, others were having, which you explained, sometimes even providing more than one solution. \n\nThanks very much. I have developed a passion for R. Also the lessons I have learned will help me massively with the large dataset I have to work with for my PhD. Making my data cleaning reproducible and also much faster! \nCheers!","DEAR TED,\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH. I AM VERY MUCH IMPRESSED BY YOUR SKILL. HOPE TO SEE THESE KINDS OF COURSES IN FUTURE TOO.\nTHANK YOU","Do more exercise and assignment.","\"Dear Ted\",\nI learn a lot  through practice and the course gave that opportunity","Dear Ted, \n\nThis first lesson was great! I don't really have any complaints or suggestions yet. I'm excited to keep learning. \n","Dear Ted,\nIt was fun to virtually \"sit in\" on your class and learn how you do it. Very helpful.","Dear Ted\nThank you for this wonderful opportunity.","Dear Ted\nIt was great to indulge in ready for R class.","Dear Ted,\n\nGreat Course! I came in with some tidyverse knowledge, but I was happy to get solid reinforcement on all the data science essentials.\n\nI think the teaching pace over the whole course was good. Files and code had been updated (as seen during videos), and I didn't find or have many issues. \n\nAlso, I hope my muddiest points weren't too harsh or too general, haha.\n\nI originally tried going through R4DS as my start to the field of data science, and it turned out to be sort of dense/overwhelming. This course, including some other intro books, helped me walk through the material at a more digestible pace. \n\nOne possibly cool thing (maybe only to me, haha) would be to add a challenge problem at the end of each part that is \"hard\" but meant to transition to the next unit to get students thinking about problems and solutions. I can understand if there is not enough time, just a passing thought.\n\nThank you for all of this content, I know it will help me on my journey to finding a career in data science.\n\nThanks Ted!"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>dear_ted<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":100,"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0}]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
